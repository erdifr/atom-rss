# Atom RSS

A plugin that adds [Atom](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287) and [RSS](http://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification) feeds to [Bludit - Flat-File CMS](https://github.com/bludit/bludit) powered websites.



## What does it do?

Atom RSS combines [Atom Feed](https://github.com/erdifr/atom-feed) and [RSS Feed 2](https://github.com/erdifr/rss-feed-2) into one plugin. Now you can install one plugin instead of two and receive the same benefits.



## Requirements

- [Bludit](https://github.com/bludit/bludit) ```v3.8.1``` - Not tested with any other version.



## Version History

- ```v0.0.1``` - Initial version.
	- Combined [Atom Feed](https://github.com/erdifr/atom-feed) and [RSS Feed 2](https://github.com/erdifr/rss-feed-2) into one plugin and unified settings menu.
	- Atom and RSS Feed Copyright is disabled by default.
	- RSS feed ```ttl``` removed from settings menu.
	- RSS feed ```ttl``` is ```60``` minutes (recommended setting).
